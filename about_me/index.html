                <p id="f_text">Featured as a NYC Change Maker by Conscious Magazine in February 2016, Pinky's passion for people and strong understanding of the importance of investing in genuine human relationships evidently shines through every action she takes and decision she makes.</p>
                <p id="t_text">Today, Pinky serves as the Community Experience Associate at DataKind, which was named one of Fast Company's Most Innovative nonprofit organization in 2017. DataKind harnesses the power of data science in the service of humanity. She is also one of the co-founders of asha bridal box, offering timeless pieces made by survivors of sex trafficking in Nepal. We provide restoration through giving sewing work to these brilliant powerful women.</p>
                <p id="th_text">Pinky came from leading numerous outreach campaigns, creative fundraising events through social media, and unconventional social justice movements towards the anti human trafficking cause for organizations like International Justice Mission, Dressember Foundation, Restore NYC, A21, and LOVE146 to managing projects involving improvement of outreach methods for NYC at-risk families of becoming homeless, classification of deaths in the Syrian Crisis as collateral damage or a targeted events, and analysis of educational impact of writing poetry in high school communities with the data technology startup, SumAll.org.  She derives her energy from creative entrepreneurial and fast-paced environments.</p>
                <p id="fo_text">Connecting the talents of people in her network for pushing goals towards positive social change is one of her favorite activities.  She believes that there are multiple solutions to many of today's problems, we just have to be aware of all the possibilities.</p>
